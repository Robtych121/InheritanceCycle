# The Inheritance Cycle Website

This project is for the User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project By Code Institute

This website was created to present inforation about the book series "The Inheritance Cycle" written by Chrisopher Paolini. It will display information on the main characters as well as brief look at the 4 books that make up the series.

## UX
This website was designed for fans of the "The Inheritance Cycle" by Chrisopher Paolini so i wanted to keep the look and feel of the website close to the books, for example the blue buttons is a similar colour to the main characters dragon in the story.

* As a fan of the series, I wanted to list the main characters separate to the stories themselves so that fans could see this quickly without having to click too many times.

I created some Wireframes of each page (showing both desktop and mobile view). These can be found within the Wireframes folder.

## Features
The website uses some custom javaScript to change the colour of the header after you have started scrolling. 
### Features Left to Implement
I would like to increate the amount of characters within the characters page and also provide a way of filtering the types (i.e show all human characters or show just dragon characters)

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3.1)

## Testing


## Deployment
This website is hosted using the Github pages, using the master branch. Because of this, everytime i push across changes using Git, the website is automatically updated without any additional input from myself. When creating the website, i had to ensure that the main file for the website was index.html otherwise browsers wouldnt be able to load it properly.

If you wanted to run this locally, you can clone this repository directly into your editor by using the following command : `git clone https://github.com/Robtych121/InheritanceCycle.git` in the terminal. Once it has finished copying all the files you will need to run `git remote rm origin` so that any changes I make won't affect your local copy.
